# Socials Quick Reference Guide

## Question: Can Mobs Use Socials with Each Other?

**Answer: YES ‚úì**

The code in `src/mobact.c` (function `mob_emotion_activity()`) already supports mob-to-mob social interactions. No modifications needed.

### How It Works

1. Every 4 seconds (PULSE_MOB_EMOTION), mobs check for social opportunities
2. Mobs iterate through ALL characters in their room (including other mobs)
3. Based on emotions, alignment, and reputation, mobs select appropriate socials
4. Mobs execute socials using `do_action()` - works with any character target

### Configuration

Enable in-game with immortal `cedit` command:
- `mob_contextual_socials` = 1 (enable feature)
- `mob_emotion_social_chance` = 10-20 (percentage chance per tick)

## Testing Mob-to-Mob Socials

### In-Game Test
1. Create two AI-enabled mobs in a room
2. Use `cedit` to enable `mob_contextual_socials`
3. Set `mob_emotion_social_chance` to 50% for faster testing
4. Watch mobs interact with socials
5. Use `stat mob <mobname>` to check emotions

### Expected Behavior
- Mobs with opposite alignments use negative socials
- Happy mobs use positive/playful socials
- Fearful mobs use fearful/submissive socials
- No inappropriate or silly socials appear
