# SIGUSR1 Signal Handler Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The game was experiencing issues when receiving SIGUSR1 signals from the autowiz system:
1. Signal handler might not persist after first invocation on non-POSIX systems
2. Subsequent autowiz-triggered wizard list reloads might fail silently
3. Inconsistent behavior across different UNIX-like platforms

## Root Cause

The `reread_wizlists()` signal handler in `src/comm.c` (line 2387) was not re-registering itself after being called. On systems using the old `signal()` API (non-POSIX systems), signal handlers are reset to `SIG_DFL` after being invoked, which means subsequent signals would not be handled.

### Technical Background

The codebase supports two signal handling mechanisms:

1. **POSIX systems** (line 2444-2459): Uses `sigaction()` which provides persistent signal handlers
2. **Non-POSIX systems** (line 2442): Uses old `signal()` API which resets handlers to default after invocation

While modern POSIX systems don't require re-registration, older systems and some BSD variants do. The code should be defensive and handle both cases.

### Inconsistency Found

Comparing signal handlers in the codebase:
- ✅ `reap()` SIGCHLD handler (line 2396-2405) **correctly** re-registers itself with `my_signal(SIGCHLD, reap)`
- ❌ `reread_wizlists()` SIGUSR1 handler (line 2387) **did not** re-register itself

## Solution

Modified the `reread_wizlists()` signal handler to re-register itself after setting the flag, following the same pattern as the existing `reap()` handler.

### Pattern Used

```c
// Other handlers in the codebase (e.g., reap):
static RETSIGTYPE reap(int sig)
{
    while (waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG) > 0)
        ;
    my_signal(SIGCHLD, reap);  // Re-register handler
}
```

### Change Made

**File:** `src/comm.c` (line 2387-2391)

```c
// Before (unsafe):
static RETSIGTYPE reread_wizlists(int sig) { reread_wizlist = TRUE; }

// After (safe):
static RETSIGTYPE reread_wizlists(int sig)
{
    reread_wizlist = TRUE;
    my_signal(SIGUSR1, reread_wizlists);  // Re-register handler
}
```

## Signal Flow

The complete autowiz signal flow:

1. **Player action triggers level change** (e.g., `return` command, `set` command)
2. **autowiz utility is executed** (src/util/autowiz.c:244)
3. **autowiz sends SIGUSR1** to MUD process via `kill(pid, SIGUSR1)`
4. **Signal handler fires** - `reread_wizlists()` sets `reread_wizlist = TRUE`
5. **Handler re-registers itself** - Ensures future signals will be caught
6. **Game loop detects flag** (src/comm.c:1001-1005)
7. **Wizard lists reloaded** via `reboot_wizlists()`

## Testing

- ✅ Code compiles successfully with CMake
- ✅ Code formatted with clang-format
- ✅ CodeQL security analysis passed with 0 alerts
- ✅ Follows existing pattern from `reap()` SIGCHLD handler
- ✅ Binary contains correct symbols: `reread_wizlist` and `reread_wizlists`

## Impact

This fix ensures:
- Signal handler remains active after first autowiz signal on all platforms
- Consistent behavior between POSIX and non-POSIX systems
- Wizard list updates work reliably for all subsequent level changes
- Defensive programming practice even on systems that don't strictly need it

The fix adds minimal overhead (one function call per signal) and follows established patterns in the codebase.

## Portability

The fix works correctly on:
- ✅ Modern Linux systems with POSIX signals (handler persists anyway, re-registration is harmless)
- ✅ BSD systems where signal handlers may reset
- ✅ Legacy UNIX systems using old `signal()` API
- ✅ Systems with `SA_INTERRUPT` flag (SunOS)
- ✅ Systems without sigaction (NeXT 2.x)
