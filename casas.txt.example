# casas.txt - Sample house definitions file
# 
# This is an example file showing the structured format for converting
# house data to the binary hcontrol format used by Vitalia Reborn.
#
# Format: class definitions followed by house blocks
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.

# Class definitions (properties are ignored by converter, but structure must be valid)

#   owner <id>           - player ID of the owner
#   payment <timestamp>  - last payment timestamp
#   guest <id>           - guest player ID (can have multiple)
