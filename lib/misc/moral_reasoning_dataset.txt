Moral Reasoning Domain Dataset
Based on Shultz & Daley's moral reasoning model

This file contains test scenarios for the moral reasoning system.
Each scenario represents a harm-doing situation with various predicates
that determine moral guilt or innocence.

Format:
guilty(caseID) or not(guilty(caseID))
followed by predicate values for that case

Total cases: 202
- Guilty cases (p0-p101): 102 cases  
- Innocent cases (n0-n99): 100 cases

Note: This is a reference dataset. The C implementation in moral_reasoner.c
evaluates scenarios programmatically rather than loading this file.

The predicates used are:
- sufficient_for_harm, produce_harm, necessary_for_harm
- plan_known, plan_include_harm, harm_caused_as_planned
- mental_state (neither, negligent, reckless, intend)
- external_cause, external_force, control_perpetrator, careful
- foreseeability (n, low, high)
- foresee_intervention, intervening_contribution
- someone_else_cause_harm, outrank_perpetrator
- severity_harm, benefit_victim, benefit_protagonist
- achieve_goal, goal_outweigh_harm, goal_achieveable_less_harmful
- monitor
