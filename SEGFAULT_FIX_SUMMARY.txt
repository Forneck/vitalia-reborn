VITALIA REBORN - MOBILE_ACTIVITY SEGFAULT FIX
==============================================

ISSUE: Program received signal SIGSEGV in mobile_activity()
       Crash occurred intermittently on some machines but not others
       Stack trace: mobile_activity() -> heartbeat() -> game_loop() -> init_game() -> main()

ROOT CAUSE: Classic iterator bug pattern - null checks occurred AFTER pointer dereferencing

EXAMPLE OF THE BUG:
  for (vict = world[IN_ROOM(ch)].people; vict && !found;) {
      struct char_data *next_vict = vict->next_in_room;  // ← CRASH HERE if vict is NULL
      
      if (!vict || !CAN_SEE(ch, vict) || PRF_FLAGGED(vict, PRF_NOHASSLE)) {  // ← Too late!
          vict = next_vict;
          continue;
      }
  }

THE FIX:
  for (vict = world[IN_ROOM(ch)].people; vict && !found;) {
      if (!vict) {                                       // ← Check FIRST
          break;
      }
      
      struct char_data *next_vict = vict->next_in_room;  // ← Safe now
      
      if (!CAN_SEE(ch, vict) || PRF_FLAGGED(vict, PRF_NOHASSLE)) {
          vict = next_vict;
          continue;
      }
  }

LOCATIONS FIXED (8 instances in src/mobact.c):
  1. Line 123:  check_mob_level_up() viewer loop
  2. Line 237:  GOAL_HUNT_TARGET character search loop
  3. Line 303:  GOAL_EAVESDROP character search loop
  4. Line 814:  Aggressive mob victim detection loop
  5. Line 882:  Memory-based victim recognition loop
  6. Line 967:  Resource gathering character check loop
  7. Line 995:  Evil mob poison victim search loop
  8. Line 1000: Container object iteration loop

WHY WAS IT INTERMITTENT?
  - Only crashed when characters/objects were extracted during iteration
  - Memory layout differences between machines
  - Specific game state needed to trigger vulnerable code paths
  - Compiler optimization variations

TESTING PERFORMED:
  ✓ Code compiles without warnings
  ✓ Formatted with clang-format
  ✓ CodeQL security scan: 0 alerts
  ✓ Full clean rebuild successful
  ✓ Pattern matches safe existing code elsewhere in codebase
