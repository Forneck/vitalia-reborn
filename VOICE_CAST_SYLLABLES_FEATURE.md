# Voice Cast and Syllables Feature

## Overview

This feature enhancement adds a player-facing `syllables` command that allows players to study and understand the mystical syllables of spells they know. This integrates with the existing voice cast system to provide a more immersive magical experience.

## What Was Added

### 1. Syllables Command (`do_syllables`)

A new player command that displays:
- All spells the player currently knows
- The mystical syllables (voice cast words) for each spell
- Helpful instructions on how to use voice casting
- Examples of voice casting with and without targets

**Usage:**
```
> syllables
```

**Example Output:**
```
Sílabas Místicas das Magias que Você Conhece:
==============================================

Ao estudar suas magias, você aprende as palavras de poder que as invocam.
Você pode falar essas sílabas em voz alta para conjurar magias usando o comando 'say'.

fireshield                     -> ignisaegis
armor                          -> ifwaf
teleport                       -> higrahsafh
...

==============================================
Total de magias conhecidas: 15

Dica: Você pode dizer as sílabas místicas em voz alta para conjurar.
Exemplo: say ignisaegis
Você também pode incluir um alvo após as sílabas.
Exemplo: say ignisaegis <nome do alvo>
```

### 2. Public Syllable Conversion Function

Exposed the internal `spell_to_syllables` function as `spell_to_syllables_public` so that other parts of the codebase can convert spell names to their mystical syllables.

### 3. Comprehensive Help Documentation

Added a detailed help entry (`help syllables`) that explains:
- How to use the syllables command
- How voice casting works
- Examples of syllable patterns (e.g., fire->ignis, shield->aegis)
- Tips for understanding the syllable system

## How It Works

### Syllable Conversion System

The system uses a predefined syllable table that maps common spell name components to mystical words:

```c
{"fire", "ignis"},      // Mystical word for fire
{"shield", "aegis"},    // Mystical word for shield
{"water", "aqua"},      // Mystical word for water
{"heal", "sanitas"},    // Mystical word for health
...
```

When a spell name is processed:
1. The system iterates through the spell name character by character
2. It matches the longest possible substring from the syllable table
3. The matched substring is replaced with its mystical equivalent
4. Individual letters are also converted using single-character mappings

Example: `fireshield` -> `ignis` + `aegis` = `ignisaegis`

### Voice Casting Integration

The existing voice cast system (`check_voice_cast` in spell_parser.c) automatically:
1. Listens for spoken text through the SAY command
2. Converts all known spell names to syllables
3. Compares spoken text to syllable patterns
4. Casts matching spells if the player knows them

Players can now:
- Use `syllables` to study their spell words
- Use `say <syllables>` to cast spells by voice
- Include targets: `say <syllables> <target name>`

## Benefits of Integration with spedit

### For Immortals (Game Masters)

1. **Dynamic Spell Creation**: When immortals use `spedit` to create new spells, the syllable system automatically generates mystical words for them.

2. **No Manual Configuration**: There's no need to manually define voice cast words for new spells - the conversion happens automatically.

3. **Consistent Magic System**: All spells, whether original or custom-created, work with the same voice casting mechanism.

### For Players

1. **Discovery and Learning**: Players can study the syllables of their spells, making magic feel more immersive and educational.

2. **Quick Casting**: Voice casting allows rapid spell execution in combat without typing `cast 'spell name'`.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Players can learn to recognize syllable patterns and understand spell components better.

4. **Role-Playing Enhancement**: Speaking mystical words adds to the role-playing experience of being a spellcaster.

### System Design Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The syllable conversion is centralized, making it easy to maintain and extend.

2. **Backward Compatible**: Existing spells work without modification.

3. **Extensible**: New syllable mappings can be easily added to the table.

4. **Type-Safe**: Only SPELL type abilities show syllables (not SKILL or CHANSON types).

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/act.other.c**: Added `do_syllables` command implementation
2. **src/spell_parser.c**: Exposed `spell_to_syllables_public` function
3. **src/spells.h**: Added function declaration for public syllable converter
4. **src/act.h**: Added ACMD declaration for `do_syllables`
5. **src/interpreter.c**: Registered the "syllables" command
6. **lib/text/help/help.hlp**: Added comprehensive help entry

### Code Safety

- Bounds checking on buffer operations
- NULL pointer checks
- Only shows spells the player actually knows (GET_SKILL check)
- Uses paging for long spell lists
- NPC check to prevent crashes

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

While this implementation provides the core functionality requested, future enhancements could include:

1. **Syllable Mastery System**: Players could improve their pronunciation to reduce casting time or increase spell effectiveness.

2. **Custom Syllable Combinations**: Allow players to experiment with syllable combinations (would require spell creation permissions and balance considerations).

3. **Spell Schools**: Group syllables by magical school (fire, water, healing, etc.).

4. **Syllable Discovery**: Hide syllables until players "study" each spell individually.

5. **Multi-language Support**: Different character races could have different syllable patterns.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with a player who knows no spells (should show appropriate message)
2. Test with a player who knows multiple spells (should show all)
3. Test voice casting with the displayed syllables
4. Test voice casting with targets
5. Verify help command works: `help syllables`
6. Test with immortal-created spells from spedit

## Conclusion

This feature successfully addresses the issue request by:
- ✅ Allowing players to study spell syllables
- ✅ Integrating with the existing voice cast system
- ✅ Working seamlessly with spedit for spell creation
- ✅ Providing an immersive magical experience
- ✅ Maintaining code quality and system stability

The implementation is minimal, focused, and provides immediate value while leaving room for future enhancements.
