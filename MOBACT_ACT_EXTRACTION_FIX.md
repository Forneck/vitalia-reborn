# Mobact Act() Extraction Race Condition Fix

## Issue Summary

**GitHub Issue**: "Mobact new - Since the segfault on mobact still happens..."

The game was experiencing intermittent segmentation faults during mob AI processing, particularly when:
- Players were killing mobs
- Players had just finished meditating
- Char2 was playing (suggesting timing-sensitive bug)

Investigation revealed that crashes occurred "after meditation, not during" - suggesting the crash happened when player state changed from POS_MEDITING to active, triggering previously-skipped mob AI code.

## Root Cause

The `act()` function in CircleMUD/tbaMUD can trigger DG (DikuMUD Genesis) scripts attached to characters, objects, or rooms. These scripts can perform arbitrary actions including `extract_char()`, which marks a character for deletion.

When `act()` calls were made in sequence or before `hit()` calls without checking for extraction, the code would attempt to access freed memory, causing segmentation faults.

### Example Vulnerable Pattern

```c
// VULNERABLE CODE
act("$n olha para $N com indiferença.", FALSE, ch, 0, vict, TO_NOTVICT);
act("$N olha para você com indiferença.", FALSE, vict, 0, ch, TO_CHAR);
// ↑ If first act() extracted vict via DG script, second act() crashes
```

### Why This Causes Intermittent Crashes

1. Requires DG scripts attached to mobs or players that perform extraction
2. Requires specific mob AI actions to trigger (aggressive behavior, following, questing, etc.)
3. Requires timing where player state changes (e.g., from meditating to active) cause mob AI to execute
4. Different mob behaviors have different trigger rates

## Locations Fixed

### 1. Aggressive Mob Behavior (Lines 1122-1135)

**Problem**: Two sequential `act()` calls without extraction checks between them.

```c
if (rand_number(0, 20) <= GET_CHA(vict)) {
    act("$n olha para $N com indiferença.", FALSE, ch, 0, vict, TO_NOTVICT);
    act("$N olha para você com indiferença.", FALSE, vict, 0, ch, TO_CHAR);
}
```

**Fix**: Added extraction checks after each `act()` call.

```c
if (rand_number(0, 20) <= GET_CHA(vict)) {
    act("$n olha para $N com indiferença.", FALSE, ch, 0, vict, TO_NOTVICT);
    /* Safety check: act() can trigger DG scripts which may extract ch or vict */
    if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
        continue;
    if (MOB_FLAGGED(vict, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(vict, PLR_NOTDEADYET)) {
        vict = next_vict;
        continue;
    }
    act("$N olha para você com indiferença.", FALSE, vict, 0, ch, TO_CHAR);
    /* Safety check: second act() may also trigger extraction */
    if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
        continue;
    if (MOB_FLAGGED(vict, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(vict, PLR_NOTDEADYET)) {
        vict = next_vict;
        continue;
    }
}
```

**Severity**: CRITICAL - High frequency code path (aggressive mobs)

---

### 2. Poison Attempt System (Lines 1337-1350)

**Problem**: `act()` calls on victim without checking if victim was extracted.

```c
act("$n parece sussurrar algo enquanto se aproxima de você.", FALSE, ch, 0, victim, TO_VICT);
// ... no check for victim ...
act("$n se aproxima discretamente de $N por um momento.", FALSE, ch, 0, victim, TO_NOTVICT);
```

**Fix**: Added victim extraction checks after each `act()`.

```c
act("$n parece sussurrar algo enquanto se aproxima de você.", FALSE, ch, 0, victim, TO_VICT);
if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    return;
if (MOB_FLAGGED(victim, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(victim, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    return;
// ... second act() with checks ...
```

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Less frequent (only evil mobs with steal skill)

---

### 3. Group Joining (Line 1708)

**Problem**: `act()` call without checking if characters were extracted.

```c
join_group(ch, GROUP(best_target_leader));
act("$n junta-se ao grupo de $N.", TRUE, ch, 0, best_target_leader, TO_ROOM);
return TRUE;
```

**Fix**: Added extraction checks, return FALSE if extracted.

```c
join_group(ch, GROUP(best_target_leader));
act("$n junta-se ao grupo de $N.", TRUE, ch, 0, best_target_leader, TO_ROOM);
if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    return FALSE;
if (MOB_FLAGGED(best_target_leader, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(best_target_leader, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    return FALSE;
return TRUE;
```

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Requires mob grouping genetics to be active

---

### 4. Stealth Following (Lines 2403-2412)

**Problem**: Multiple `act()` calls without extraction checks between them.

```c
act("Você agora irá seguir $N.", FALSE, ch, 0, target, TO_CHAR);
if (CAN_SEE(target, ch))
    act("$n começa a seguir você.", TRUE, ch, 0, target, TO_VICT);
act("$n começa a seguir $N.", TRUE, ch, 0, target, TO_NOTVICT);
```

**Fix**: Added extraction checks after each `act()` call.

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Requires mob follow genetics to be active

---

### 5. Hunt Target Goal (Line 291)

**Problem**: `act()` followed by `hit()` without checking if target was extracted.

```c
act("$n se concentra em $N com olhos determinados.", FALSE, ch, 0, target, TO_ROOM);
hit(ch, target, TYPE_UNDEFINED);
```

**Fix**: Added target extraction check, clear goal if target is gone.

```c
act("$n se concentra em $N com olhos determinados.", FALSE, ch, 0, target, TO_ROOM);
if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    continue;
if (MOB_FLAGGED(target, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(target, PLR_NOTDEADYET)) {
    /* Target was extracted, give up hunting */
    ch->ai_data->current_goal = GOAL_NONE;
    ch->ai_data->goal_target_mob_rnum = NOBODY;
    ch->ai_data->goal_item_vnum = NOTHING;
    ch->ai_data->goal_timer = 0;
    continue;
}
hit(ch, target, TYPE_UNDEFINED);
```

**Severity**: HIGH - Hunting behavior is common with wishlist system

---

### 6. Key Collection Goal (Line 686)

**Problem**: `act()` followed by `hit()` without checking if target was extracted.

**Fix**: Added target extraction checks before `hit()`.

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Only triggers when mob needs key for locked door

---

### 7. Quest Mob Kill (Line 3562)

**Problem**: `act()` followed by `hit()` in quest completion logic.

**Fix**: Added target_mob extraction checks.

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Only affects mobs with active kill quests

---

### 8. Room Clear Quest (Line 3637)

**Problem**: `act()` followed by `hit()` when clearing room of mobs.

**Fix**: Added temp_mob extraction checks, continue searching if target extracted.

```c
act("$n ataca $N para limpar a área.", FALSE, ch, 0, temp_mob, TO_ROOM);
if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    return TRUE;
if (MOB_FLAGGED(temp_mob, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(temp_mob, PLR_NOTDEADYET)) {
    found_hostile = FALSE; /* Target was extracted, continue searching */
    continue;
}
hit(ch, temp_mob, TYPE_UNDEFINED);
```

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Only affects mobs with room clear quests

---

## Technical Details

### The act() Function

The `act()` function in CircleMUD is used to generate messages to players and observers. It has this signature:

```c
void act(const char *str, int hide_invisible, struct char_data *ch,
         struct obj_data *obj, const void *vict_obj, int type);
```

**Key behavior**: After formatting and sending messages, `act()` triggers DG scripts on:
- The actor (`ch`)
- Any objects involved (`obj`)
- The victim/target (`vict_obj`)
- The room

### DG Scripts Can Extract Characters

DG scripts can call functions like:
- `%purge%` - Extract an object or character
- `%damage%` - Deal damage (which may kill and extract)
- Other commands that indirectly cause extraction

### The NOTDEADYET Flag

When a character is marked for extraction, the system sets:
- `MOB_NOTDEADYET` flag for NPCs
- `PLR_NOTDEADYET` flag for players

The character is not immediately freed but marked for later cleanup. This prevents mid-function crashes but requires checking before dereferencing.

## Testing

### Build Testing
```bash
$ cd src && make clean && make
# Result: ✅ Successful build with 0 errors, 0 warnings in mobact.c
```

### Code Quality
- ✅ Formatted with `clang-format` per project standards
- ✅ All fixes follow defensive programming patterns
- ✅ Consistent with existing NOTDEADYET checks in codebase
- ✅ Minimal changes - only add safety checks where needed

## Impact

### Prevents Crashes When:
- Aggressive mobs encounter players with DG scripts
- Mobs attempt poison attacks on scripted players
- Mobs join groups with scripted leaders
- Mobs follow scripted targets
- Mobs hunt targets that have extraction scripts
- Mobs complete quests involving scripted NPCs
- Any `act()` call triggers a script that extracts participants

### Why This Explains the Reported Symptoms:

1. **"Crashes when killing mobs"**: Combat involves many `act()` calls and mob deaths trigger scripts
2. **"Crashes after meditation, not during"**: When player position changes from POS_MEDITING (skips most mob AI) to active, mob AI suddenly executes with accumulated state
3. **"Crashes more with Char2"**: If Char2's character has more DG scripts attached, or interacts with scripted mobs more frequently
4. **"Random/intermittent"**: Requires specific DG script + specific mob AI action + timing alignment

## Prevention Guidelines

For future development when using `act()`:

1. **Always check for extraction after act() calls**
   ```c
   act("Message", FALSE, ch, obj, vict, TO_ROOM);
   if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
       return/continue;
   if (vict && (MOB_FLAGGED(vict, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(vict, PLR_NOTDEADYET)))
       return/continue;
   ```

2. **Especially critical before:**
   - Calling `hit()` - will crash if target is freed
   - Accessing character pointers - may be dangling
   - Calling another `act()` with the same characters

3. **Code review checklist:**
   - [ ] All `act()` calls have extraction checks after them
   - [ ] `act()` followed by `hit()` has target extraction check
   - [ ] Sequential `act()` calls have checks between them
   - [ ] Function returns/continues if extraction detected

## Related Documentation

This fix complements previous mobact fixes:
- `MOBACT_EXTRACT_FIX.md` - General extraction safety
- `MOBACT_RACE_CONDITION_SUMMARY.md` - Nested iteration safety
- `HUNT_VICTIM_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md` - Hunt victim extraction safety
- `MOBACT_SHOPPING_SEGFAULT_FIX.md` - Shopping system crashes
- `MOBACT_ADDITIONAL_SIGSEGV_FIXES.md` - Array bounds and helper function safety

Together these provide comprehensive protection against extraction-related crashes in mobile_activity().

## Conclusion

This fix addresses a critical class of segmentation faults caused by the `act()` function triggering DG scripts that extract characters. By adding consistent extraction checks after all `act()` calls involving multiple characters, especially before `hit()` calls, we prevent the most common and severe crash scenarios.

The fix is surgical, defensive, and consistent with existing patterns in the codebase. It adds minimal overhead (simple flag checks) while significantly improving stability.
