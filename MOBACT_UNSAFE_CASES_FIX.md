# Mobile Activity Unsafe Cases Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

This fix addresses additional unsafe cases in `mobile_activity()` function in `mobact.c` that could cause segmentation faults. These issues were identified during a security review following previous fixes for auto quests and other crash scenarios.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Unsafe Object Iteration with obj_from_room/obj_from_obj (Lines 535-563)

**Pattern:**
```c
// UNSAFE - modifies the list being iterated
for (key_obj = world[IN_ROOM(ch)].contents; key_obj; key_obj = key_obj->next_content) {
    obj_from_room(key_obj);  // ← Removes object from list
    obj_to_char(key_obj, ch);
    break;
}
```

**Why This Causes Segfaults:**
1. `obj_from_room()` removes the object from the room's contents linked list
2. This modifies the `next_content` pointer chain
3. If we don't `break` immediately (or if the break is inside nested conditions), the next iteration accesses corrupted memory
4. Similar issue with `obj_from_obj()` for objects in containers

**Impact:**
- Crash when mob attempts to collect keys in GOAL_COLLECT_KEY
- Happens when the key is found but there are other objects in the list
- More likely to crash in rooms with many objects or containers

### 2. Critical: char_from_room with Invalid Room Access (Lines 3023-3026, 3047-3050)

**Pattern:**
```c
// EXTREMELY UNSAFE - accesses world array with NOWHERE index
char_from_room(ch);  // ← Sets IN_ROOM(ch) = NOWHERE
char_to_room(ch, world[IN_ROOM(ch)].dir_option[...]  // ← CRASH! world[NOWHERE] is out of bounds
                     ? world[IN_ROOM(ch)].dir_option[...]->to_room
                     : IN_ROOM(ch));
```

**Why This Causes Segfaults:**
1. `char_from_room(ch)` sets `IN_ROOM(ch) = NOWHERE` (defined as -1)
2. Immediately after, code tries to access `world[IN_ROOM(ch)]` which is `world[-1]`
3. This is an array bounds violation causing immediate segfault
4. Even if it doesn't crash, the logic is broken because it's trying to get direction from NOWHERE

**Additional Problems:**
- `world[IN_ROOM(ch)].dir_option[rand() % NUM_OF_DIRS]` can be NULL
- No validation that the exit exists before dereferencing
- No validation that `to_room` is valid

**Impact:**
- **CRITICAL**: Guaranteed crash when mobs are on AQ_MOB_FIND or AQ_MOB_KILL quests
- Happens 50% of the time when target mob is not found
- Array bounds violation is undefined behavior - could crash or corrupt memory

### 3. Use-After-Free in shopping_sell (Line 394)

**Pattern:**
```c
shopping_sell(ch->ai_data->goal_obj->name, ch, keeper, shop_rnum);
// ← goal_obj is now a dangling pointer (object was extracted)
// Later on line 429...
for (obj = ch->carrying; obj; obj = obj->next_content) {
    // Still uses ch->ai_data->goal_obj implicitly in the logic
}
```

**Why This Causes Problems:**
1. `shopping_sell()` calls `extract_obj()` on the sold item
2. `ch->ai_data->goal_obj` becomes a dangling pointer
3. Although line 429 doesn't directly dereference goal_obj, the logic context suggests it could be used
4. Best practice is to NULL it immediately after extraction

**Impact:**
- Potential use-after-free if code changes
- Defensive programming violation
- Could cause subtle bugs in future modifications

### 4. Missing Safety Check After shopping_buy (Line 467)

**Pattern:**
```c
shopping_buy(buy_command, ch, keeper, find_shop_by_keeper(keeper->nr));
// ← Could trigger scripts that extract ch
remove_item_from_wishlist(ch, ...);  // ← Accesses ch without checking
```

**Why This Causes Problems:**
1. `shopping_buy()` can trigger DG Scripts through shop special procedures
2. Scripts could potentially extract the character
3. Continued execution after extraction causes undefined behavior

**Impact:**
- Rare but possible crash scenario
- Depends on custom shop scripts in the game world
- Defensive programming gap

## Solution

### Fix 1: Safe Object Iteration with Safety Variables

**Implementation:**
```c
/* Declare safety variables */
struct obj_data *key_obj = NULL, *next_obj = NULL;

/* Save next pointer BEFORE modification */
for (key_obj = world[IN_ROOM(ch)].contents; key_obj; key_obj = next_obj) {
    next_obj = key_obj->next_content;  // ← Save before obj_from_room
    if (GET_OBJ_TYPE(key_obj) == ITEM_KEY && GET_OBJ_VNUM(key_obj) == target_key) {
        obj_from_room(key_obj);  // ← Safe: next_obj already saved
        obj_to_char(key_obj, ch);
        key_collected = TRUE;
        break;
    }
}
```

**Applied to:**
- Line 535: Room contents iteration (key on ground)
- Line 548-550: Container iteration (key in container)

**Why This Works:**
- `next_obj` is saved before any list modification
- Even if `obj_from_room()` corrupts the list, we have the next pointer
- Follows the same safe pattern used in the main character loop

### Fix 2: Replace Unsafe char_from_room with mob_goal_oriented_roam

**Implementation:**
```c
/* OLD - CRASHES */
// char_from_room(ch);
// char_to_room(ch, world[IN_ROOM(ch)].dir_option[...] ...);

/* NEW - SAFE */
mob_goal_oriented_roam(ch, NOWHERE); /* Roam randomly */
/* Safety check: mob_goal_oriented_roam uses perform_move which can trigger death traps */
if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    return TRUE;
```

**Applied to:**
- Line 3032: AQ_MOB_FIND quest type
- Line 3056: AQ_MOB_KILL/AQ_MOB_KILL_BOUNTY quest types

**Why This Works:**
- `mob_goal_oriented_roam()` properly handles room validation
- It uses `perform_move()` which has proper safety checks
- Passing NOWHERE as destination makes it roam randomly
- Existing safety check pattern protects against death traps
- No manual char_from_room/char_to_room needed

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates array bounds violation
- Proper direction validation
- Consistent with other movement code
- Adds death trap protection

### Fix 3: NULL goal_obj After Extraction

**Implementation:**
```c
shopping_sell(ch->ai_data->goal_obj->name, ch, keeper, shop_rnum);
/* Clear goal_obj pointer as the object has been extracted by shopping_sell */
ch->ai_data->goal_obj = NULL;
```

**Applied to:**
- Line 394: After shopping_sell call

**Why This Works:**
- Immediately marks the pointer as invalid
- Prevents accidental use-after-free
- Defensive programming best practice
- Consistent with other pointer clearing patterns

### Fix 4: Add Safety Check After shopping_buy

**Implementation:**
```c
shopping_buy(buy_command, ch, keeper, find_shop_by_keeper(keeper->nr));

/* Safety check: shopping operations could indirectly cause extract_char
 * through scripts, triggers, or special procedures */
if (MOB_FLAGGED(ch, MOB_NOTDEADYET) || PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET))
    continue;

remove_item_from_wishlist(ch, ch->ai_data->goal_item_vnum);
```

**Applied to:**
- Line 467: After shopping_buy call

**Why This Works:**
- Catches any script-triggered extractions
- Consistent with existing safety check pattern
- Prevents access to extracted character
- Minimal performance overhead

## Files Modified

- `src/mobact.c` - 4 critical safety fixes applied:
  1. Lines 535-563: Safe object iteration in key collection
  2. Line 394: NULL goal_obj after shopping_sell
  3. Line 467: Add safety check after shopping_buy
  4. Lines 3023-3036: Replace unsafe char_from_room with mob_goal_oriented_roam (AQ_MOB_FIND)
  5. Lines 3047-3060: Replace unsafe char_from_room with mob_goal_oriented_roam (AQ_MOB_KILL)

## Testing

### Build Testing
- ✅ Compiles successfully with GCC
- ✅ No compiler warnings in mobact.c
- ✅ Autotools build successful
- ✅ Binary created: bin/circle (5.4M)

### Code Quality
- ✅ Formatted with clang-format (project style)
- ✅ Consistent with existing safety patterns
- ✅ Follows defensive programming principles

## Impact

### Prevents Crashes When:
1. **Key Collection**: Mobs collecting keys from rooms or containers
2. **Quest Movement**: Mobs searching for quest targets (AQ_MOB_FIND, AQ_MOB_KILL)
3. **Shopping**: Mobs selling items and the object chain is modified
4. **Shopping Scripts**: Custom shop scripts that might extract characters

### Severity Assessment:
- **Fix 1 (Object Iteration)**: Medium severity - Crash likely in rooms with multiple objects
- **Fix 2 (char_from_room)**: **CRITICAL** - Guaranteed crash, array bounds violation
- **Fix 3 (goal_obj)**: Low severity - Defensive programming, prevents future bugs
- **Fix 4 (shopping_buy)**: Low-Medium severity - Depends on custom scripts

### Performance Impact:
- Negligible overhead (one pointer assignment per iteration)
- Slightly better: Eliminates one manual movement path in favor of existing safe function

## Prevention Guidelines

For future development:

1. **Never access world[IN_ROOM(ch)] after char_from_room(ch)**
   - IN_ROOM(ch) becomes NOWHERE (-1) after char_from_room
   - Save room number before calling char_from_room if needed

2. **Always use safety variables when calling obj_from_room/obj_from_obj**
   - Pattern: `next_obj = obj->next_content` BEFORE list modification
   - Similar to character list iteration pattern

3. **NULL pointers immediately after extraction**
   - After extract_obj(), NULL any pointers to that object
   - Prevents use-after-free bugs

4. **Add safety checks after operations that might extract**
   - Shopping functions can trigger scripts
   - Check NOTDEADYET flags after any complex operation

5. **Use existing safe functions when available**
   - Use `mob_goal_oriented_roam()` instead of manual char_from_room/char_to_room
   - Use `perform_move()` wrapper functions that include validation

## Related Fixes

This fix complements previous safety improvements:
- **MOBILE_ACTIVITY_FIX.md**: Null pointer bug fixes in iterators
- **MOBACT_EXTRACT_FIX.md**: Safety checks after extraction operations
- **MOBACT_RACE_CONDITION_SUMMARY.md**: Safe nested iterations
- **SIGSEGV_FIX.md**: Room validation checks

Together, these create comprehensive protection against crash scenarios in mobile_activity().

## Conclusion

These fixes address critical unsafe patterns that could cause immediate crashes (char_from_room bug) and potential future crashes (object iteration, pointer corruption). The most critical fix is replacing the manual char_from_room/char_to_room calls with proper safe movement functions, eliminating a guaranteed crash scenario in quest completion code.

All fixes follow existing code patterns and defensive programming principles, maintaining code consistency and readability.
